Hi, I'm Claris Li. I am a software development manager based in Taipei. I've worked for several starups, some no longer exist, and one eventually grew into a major social platform. 

In this space, I write about the stuff I learn, mainly artificial intelligence, software development and engineering management. 

You can find out what I am doing now at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarisli/) profile.
